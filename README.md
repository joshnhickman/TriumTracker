TriumTracker
============
Simple app to help track initiative for tabletop games. This is meant to be completely separate
from the rules for the game being played; iniative is set by the user instead of calculated. The
expectation is that players are still rolling their own initiative and feeding it into the app.
This means that ties for initiative cannot be handled properly per game; it is decided randomly
who goes first. I hope to add functionality to allow you to drag and drop characters to resolve
order manually by game rules.

Usage
=====
Tap the "+" at the top right to add a new character. Checking "Ally" turns the background
green, while unchecking it turns the background red. Once a character is created, tap it in the
list to modify its initiative score or delete. Tapping the trash can at the top right clears
all characters.
